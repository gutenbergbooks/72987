<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>A few of these poems may be difficult to understand, perhaps more difficult than I know. Goethe has said that the poet needs all philosophy, but that he must keep it out of his work. After the first few poems I came into possession of Michael Robartes’ exposition of the <i>Speculum Angelorum et Hominum</i> of Geraldus, and in the excitement of arranging and editing could no more keep out philosophy than could Goethe himself at certain periods of his life. I have tried to make understanding easy by a couple of notes, which are at anyrate much shorter than those Dante wrote on certain of his odes in the <i>Convito</i>, but I may not have succeeded. It is hard for a writer, who has spent much labour upon his style, to remember that thought, which seems to him natural and logical like that style, may be unintelligible to others. The first excitement over, and the thought changed into settled conviction, his interest in simple, that is to say in normal emotion, is always I think increased; he is no longer looking for candlestick and matches but at the objects in the room.</p>

<p>I have given no account of Robartes himself, nor of his discovery of the explanation of Geraldus’ diagrams and pictures in the traditional knowledge of a certain obscure Arab tribe, for I hope that my selection from the great mass of his letters and table talk, which I owe to his friend John Aherne, may be published before, or at any rate but soon after this little book, which, like all hand-printed books will take a long time for the setting up and printing off and for the drying of the pages.</p>

<span>In this altar-piece the knight,<br></span>

<span>Loved the lady; and it’s plain<br></span>
<span>The half-dead dragon was her thought,<br></span>
<span>That every morning rose again<br></span>
<span>And dug its claws and shrieked and fought.<br></span>
<span>Could the impossible come to pass<br></span>

<span>That all must come to sight and touch;<br></span>
<span>While Michael Angelo’s Sistine roof<br></span>
<span>His ‘Morning’ and his ‘Night’ disclose<br></span>
<span>How sinew that has been pulled tight,<br></span>

<h2>Solomon and the Witch</h2>
<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span>And thus declared that Arab lady:<br></span>
<span>“Last night, where under the wild moon<br></span>
<span>On grassy mattress I had laid me,<br></span>
<span>Within my arms great Solomon,<br></span>
<span>I suddenly cried out in a strange tongue<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
<span>Not his, not mine.”</span>
<span>And he that knew</span>
<br></span>
<span>All sounds by bird or angel sung<br></span>
<span>Answered: “A crested cockerel crew<br></span>
<span>Upon a blossoming apple bough<br></span>
<span>Three hundred years before the Fall,<br></span>
<span>And never crew again till now,<br></span>
<span>And would not now but that he thought,<br></span>
<span>Chance being at one with Choice at last.<br></span>
<span>All that the brigand apple brought<br></span>
<span>And this foul world were dead at last.<br></span>
<span>He that crowed out eternity<br></span>
<span>Thought to have crowed it in again.<br></span>
<span>A lover with a spider’s eye<br></span>
<span>Will find out some appropriate pain,<br></span>
<span>Aye, though all passion’s in the glance,<br></span>
<span>For every nerve: lover tests lover<br></span>
<span>With cruelties of Choice and Chance;<br></span>
<span>And when at last that murder’s over<br></span>
<span>Maybe the bride-bed brings despair<br></span>
<span>For each an imagined image brings<br></span>
<span>And finds a real image there;<br></span>
<span>Yet the world ends when these two things,<br></span>
<span>Though several, are a single light,<br></span>
<span>When oil and wick are burned in one;<br></span>
<span>Therefore a blessed moon last night<br></span>
<span>Gave Sheba to her Solomon.”<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="dl2">
<span>“Yet the world stays:”</span>
<span>“If that be so,</span>
<br></span>
<span>Your cockerel found us in the wrong<br></span>
<span>Although he thought it worth a crow.<br></span>
<span>Maybe an image is too strong<br></span>
<span>Or maybe is not strong enough.”<br></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span>“The night has fallen; not a sound<br></span>
<span>In the forbidden sacred grove<br></span>
<span>Unless a petal hit the ground,<br></span>
<span>Nor any human sight within it<br></span>
<span>But the crushed grass where we have lain;<br></span>
<span>And the moon is wilder every minute.<br></span>
<span>Oh, Solomon! let us try again.”<br></span>

<h2>An Image from a Past Life</h2>
<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<p class="speaker">He</p>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Never until this night have I been stirred.<br></span>
<span>The elaborate star-light has thrown reflections<br></span>
<span>On the dark stream,<br></span>
<span>Till all the eddies gleam;<br></span>
<span>And thereupon there comes that scream<br></span>
<span>From terrified, invisible beast or bird:<br></span>
<span>Image of poignant recollection.<br></span>
</div>
<p class="speaker">She</p>
<div class="stanza">
<span>An image of my heart that is smitten through<br></span>
<span>Out of all likelihood, or reason.<br></span>
<span>And when at last,<br></span>
<span>Youth’s bitterness being past,<br></span>
<span>I had thought that all my days were cast<br></span>
<span>Amid most lovely places; smitten as though<br></span>
<span>It had not learned its lesson.<br></span>
</div>
<p class="speaker">He</p>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Why have you laid your hands upon my eyes?<br></span>
<span>What can have suddenly alarmed you<br></span>
<span>Whereon ’twere best<br></span>
<span>My eyes should never rest?<br></span>
<span>What is there but the slowly fading west,<br></span>
<span>The river imaging the flashing skies,<br></span>
<span>All that to this moment charmed you?<br></span>
</div>
<p class="speaker">She</p>
<div class="stanza">
<span>A sweetheart from another life floats there<br></span>
<span>As though she had been forced to linger<br></span>
<span>From vague distress<br></span>
<span>Or arrogant loveliness.<br></span>
<span>Merely to loosen out a tress<br></span>
<span>Among the starry eddies of her hair<br></span>
<span>Upon the paleness of a finger.<br></span>
</div>
<p class="speaker">He</p>
<div class="stanza">
<span>But why should you grow suddenly afraid<br></span>
<span>And start— I at your shoulder—<br></span>
<span>Imagining<br></span>
<span>That any night could bring<br></span>
<span>An image up, or anything<br></span>
<span>Even to eyes that beauty had driven mad,<br></span>
<span>But images to make me fonder.<br></span>
</div>
<p class="speaker">She</p>
<div class="stanza">
<span>Now she has thrown her arms above her head;<br></span>
<span>Whether she threw them up to flout me,<br></span>
<span>Or but to find,<br></span>
<span>Now that no fingers bind,<br></span>
<span>That her hair streams upon the wind,<br></span>
<span>I do not know, that know I am afraid<br></span>
<span>Of the hovering thing night brought me.<br></span>

<h2>Under Saturn</h2>
<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span>Do not because this day I have grown saturnine<br></span>
<span>Imagine that some lost love, unassailable<br></span>
<span>Being a portion of my youth, can make me pine<br></span>
<span>And so forget the comfort that no words can tell<br></span>
<span>Your coming brought; though I acknowledge I have gone<br></span>
<span>On a fantastic ride, my horses flanks were spurred<br></span>
<span>By childish memories of an old cross Pollexfen,<br></span>
<span>And of a Middleton, whose name you never heard,<br></span>
<span>And of a red-haired Yeats whose looks, although he died<br></span>
<span>Before my time, seem like a vivid memory.<br></span>
<span class="dl2">
<span>You heard that labouring man</span>
<span>who had served my people. He said</span>
<br></span>
<span>Upon the open road, near to the Sligo quay—<br></span>
<span>No, no, not said, but cried it out—“You have come again<br></span>
<span>And surely after twenty years it was time to come.”<br></span>
<span>I am thinking of a child’s vow sworn in vain<br></span>
<span>Never to leave that valley his fathers called their home.<br></span>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h3>AN IMAGE FROM A PAST LIFE</h3>

<p>Robartes writes to Aherne under the date May 12th, 1917. “I found among the Judwalis much biographical detail, probably legendary, about Kusta-ben-Luki. He saw occasionally during sleep a woman’s face and later on found in a Persian painting a face resembling, though not identical with the dream-face, which was he considered that of a woman loved in another life. Presently he met &amp; loved a beautiful woman whose face also resembled, without being identical, that of his dream. Later on he made a long journey to purchase the painting which was, he said, the better likeness, and found on his return that his mistress had left him in a fit of jealousy.” In a dialogue and in letters, Robartes gives a classification and analysis of dreams which explain the survival of this story among the followers of Kusta-ben-Luki. They distinguished between the memory of concrete images and the abstract memory, and affirm that no concrete dream-image is ever from our memory. This is not only true they say of dreams, but of those visions seen between sleeping and waking. This doctrine at first found me incredulous, for I thought it contradicted by my experience and by all I have read, not however a very great amount, in books of psychology and of psycho-analysis. Did I not frequently dream of some friend, or relation, or that I was at school? I found, however, when I studied my dreams, as I was directed in a dialogue, that the image seen was never really that of friend, or relation, or my old school, though it might very closely resemble it. A substitution had taken place, often a very strange one, though I forgot this if I did not notice it at once on waking. The name of some friend, or the conceptions “my father” and “at school,” are a part of the abstract memory and therefore of the dream life, but the image of my father, or my friend, or my old school, being a part of the personal concrete memory appeared neither in sleep nor in visions between sleep and waking. I found sometimes that my father, or my friend, had been represented in sleep by a stool or a chair, and I concluded that it was the entire absence of my personal concrete memory that enabled me to accept such images without surprise. Was it not perhaps this very absence that constituted sleep? Would I perhaps awake if a single concrete image from my memory came before me? Even these images—stool, chair, etc. were never any particular stool, chair, etc. that I had known. Were these images, however, from the buried memory? had they floated up from the subconscious? had I seen them perhaps a long time ago and forgotten having done so? Even if that were so, the exclusion of the conscious memory was a new, perhaps important truth; but Robartes denied their source even in the subconscious. It seems a corroboration that though I often see between sleep and waking elaborate landscape, I have never seen one that seemed a possible representation of any place I have ever lived near from childhood up. Robartes traces these substitute images to different sources. Those that come in sleep are (1) from the state immediately preceding our birth; (2) from the <i>Spiritus Mundi</i>—that is to say, from a general store-house of images which have ceased to be a property of any personality or spirit. Those that come between sleeping and waking are, he says, re-shaped by what he calls the “automatic faculty” which can create pattern, balance, etc. from the impressions made upon the senses, not of ourselves, but of others bound to us by certain emotional links though perhaps entire strangers, and preserved in a kind of impersonal mirror, often simply called the “record,” which takes much the same place in his system the lower strata of the astral light does among the disciples of Elephas Levi. This does not exhaust the contents of dreams for we have to account also for certain sentences, for certain ideas which are not concrete images and yet do not arise from our personal memory, but at the moment I have merely to account for certain images that affect passion or affection. Robartes writes to Aherne in a letter dated May 15th, 1917: “No lover, no husband has ever met in dreams the true image of wife or mistress. She who has perhaps filled his whole life with joy or disquiet cannot enter there. Her image can fill every moment of his waking life but only its counterfeit comes to him in sleep; and he who classifies these counterfeits will find that just in so far as they become concrete, sensuous, they are distinct individuals; never types but individuals. They are the forms of those whom he has loved in some past earthly life, chosen from <i>Spiritus Mundi</i> by the subconscious will, and through them, for they are not always hollow shades, the dead at whiles outface a living rival.” They are the forms of Over Shadowers as they are called. All violent passion has to be expiated or atoned, by one in life, by one in the state between life and life, because, as the Judwalis believe, there is always deceit or cruelty; but it is only in sleep that we can see these forms of those who as spirits may influence all our waking thought. Souls that are once linked by emotion never cease till the last drop of that emotion is exhausted—call it desire, hate or what you will—to affect one another, remaining always as it were in contact. Those whose past passions are unatoned seldom love living man or woman but only those loved long ago, of whom the living man or woman is but a brief symbol forgotten when some phase of some atonement is finished; but because in general the form does not pass into the memory, it is the moral being of the dead that is symbolised. Under certain circumstances, which are precisely described, the form indirectly, and not necessarily from dreams, enters the living memory; the subconscious will, as in Kusta-ben-Luki in the story, selects among pictures, or other ideal representations, some form that resembles what was once the physical body of the Over Shadower, and this ideal form becomes to the living man an obsession, continually perplexing and frustrating natural instinct. It is therefore only after full atonement or expiation, perhaps after many lives, that a natural deep satisfying love becomes possible, and this love, in all subjective natures, must precede the Beatific Vision.</p>

<p>When I wrote An Image from a Past Life, I had merely begun my study of the various papers upon the subject, but I do not think I misstated Robartes’ thought in permitting the woman and not the man to see the Over Shadower or Ideal Form, whichever it was. No mind’s contents are necessarily shut off from another, and in moments of excitement images pass from one mind to another with extraordinary ease, perhaps most easily from that portion of the mind which for the time being is outside consciousness. I use the word “pass” because it is familiar, not because I believe any movement in space to be necessary. The second mind sees what the first has already seen, that is all.</p>

<h3>THE SECOND COMING</h3>

<p>Robartes copied out and gave to Aherne several mathematical diagrams from the <i>Speculum</i>, squares and spheres, cones made up of revolving gyres intersecting each other at various angles, figures sometimes of great complexity. His explanation of these, obtained invariably from the followers of Kusta-ben-Luki, is founded upon a single fundamental thought. The mind, whether expressed in history or in the individual life, has a precise movement, which can be quickened or slackened but cannot be fundamentally altered, and this movement can be expressed by a mathematical form. A plant or an animal has an order of developement peculiar to it, a bamboo will not develop evenly like a willow, nor a willow from joint to joint, and both have branches, that lessen and grow more light as they rise, and no characteristic of the soil can alter these things. A poor soil may indeed check or stop the movement and a rich prolong and quicken it. Mendel has shown that his sweet-peas bred long and short, white and pink varieties in certain mathematical proportions, suggesting a mathematical law governing the transmission of parental characteristics. To the Judwalis, as interpreted by Michael Robartes, all living mind has likewise a fundamental mathematical movement, however adapted in plant, or animal, or man to particular circumstance; and when you have found this movement and calculated its relations, you can foretell the entire future of that mind. A supreme religious act of their faith is to fix the attention on the mathematical form of this movement until the whole past and future of humanity, or of an individual man, shall be present to the intellect as if it were accomplished in a single moment. The intensity of the Beatific Vision when it comes depends upon the intensity of this realisation. It is possible in this way, seeing that death is itself marked upon the mathematical figure, which passes beyond it, to follow the soul into the highest heaven and the deepest hell. This doctrine is, they contend, not fatalistic because the mathematical figure is an expression of the mind’s desire, and the more rapid the developement of the figure the greater the freedom of the soul. The figure while the soul is in the body, or suffering from the consequences of that life, is frequently drawn as a double cone, the narrow end of each cone being in the centre of the broad end of the other.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/illustration.png" alt="A line drawing of two cones superimposed on each other, with the tip of each cone in the centre of the base of the other.">
</div>

<p class="continued">It has its origin from a straight line which represents, now time, now emotion, now subjective life, and a plane at right angles to this line which represents, now space, now intellect, now objective life; while it is marked out by two gyres which represent the conflict, as it were, of plane and line, by two movements, which circle about a centre because a movement outward on the plane is checked by and in turn checks a movement onward upon the line; &amp; the circling is always narrowing or spreading, because one movement or other is always the stronger. In other words, the human soul is always moving outward into the objective world or inward into itself; &amp; this movement is double because the human soul would not be conscious were it not suspended between contraries, the greater the contrast the more intense the consciousness. The man, in whom the movement inward is stronger than the movement outward, the man who sees all reflected within himself, the subjective man, reaches the narrow end of a gyre at death, for death is always, they contend, even when it seems the result of accident, preceded by an intensification of the subjective life; and has a moment of revelation immediately after death, a revelation which they describe as his being carried into the presence of all his dead kindred, a moment whose objectivity is exactly equal to the subjectivity of death. The objective man on the other hand, whose gyre moves outward, receives at this moment the revelation, not of himself seen from within, for that is impossible to objective man, but of himself as if he were somebody else. This figure is true also of history, for the end of an age, which always receives the revelation of the character of the next age, is represented by the coming of one gyre to its place of greatest expansion and of the other to that of its greatest contraction. At the present moment the life gyre is sweeping outward, unlike that before the birth of Christ which was narrowing, and has almost reached its greatest expansion. The revelation which approaches will however take its character from the contrary movement of the interior gyre. All our scientific, democratic, fact-accumulating, heterogeneous civilization belongs to the outward gyre and prepares not the continuance of itself but the revelation as in a lightning flash, though in a flash that will not strike only in one place, and will for a time be constantly repeated, of the civilization that must slowly take its place. This is too simple a statement, for much detail is possible. There are certain points of stress on outer and inner gyre, a division of each, now into ten, now into twenty-eight, stages or phases. However in the exposition of this detail so far as it affects the future, Robartes had little help from the Judwalis either because they cannot grasp events outside their experience, or because certain studies seem to them unlucky. “‘For a time the power’ they have said to me,” (writes Robartes) “‘will be with us, who are as like one another as the grains of sand, but when the revelation comes it will not come to the poor but to the great and learned and establish again for two thousand years prince &amp; vizier. Why should we resist? Have not our wise men marked it upon the sand, and it is because of these marks, made generation after generation by the old for the young, that we are named Judwalis.’”</p>

<p>Their name means makers of measures, or as we would say, of diagrams.</p>
